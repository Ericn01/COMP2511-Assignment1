                    The folks here at <emph> The Chimpanzee Foundation </emph> are constantly striving to improve our website's layout. By improving the design of our page, using modern web design features such as responsise design and grid layouts, we are also adding value to the user's experience.

                    <p>Easier web flow and better looking visuals that fit on any users screen, from smartphones to giant flat screen TV's is the name of the game. Grid layouts allows a page to be structured into several columns and rows, each containing a "block" or container. This allows for a neatly with minimal effort, something that would've taken a lot of effort in the past.

                        Chimpanzees, commonly referred to as chimps, is a species of animals that is a part of the great ape family (The same as us humans!).
                         They can be found roaming jungles and savannas across central and western Africa. What makes these animals so special is that they share 98.7% of humans genetic material!

                         This shouldn't come as a surprise, as humans and chimpanzees are both direct desendants of our ancient ancestor: the hominini. This split occured around 6.3 million years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just like humans, chimpanzees are highly social creatures that live in communities. They also have the ability to be bipedal, although they usually walk around on all fours. 
                
                        Chimpanzees vary considerably in size and appearance, although males stand between 140cm - 170cm tall. In terms of weight, most males weigh between 40-70kg while females weigh between 27-50kg.
    
                        Chimps are covered by a coat of brown or black hair, except for the faces which are completely bare.

                        <h3>  Intelligence </h3>
                        Chimpanzee intelligence is as sophisticated and effective in their world as human intelligence is in our own world. They have been shown to be able to replicate just about everything that a five year old human is able to do.  Adult chimpanzees exhibit more mature intelligence, while  infants act almost exclusively on impulses. Some chimpanzees aren't that intelligent while others could almost be considered geniuses. The range of intelligence of chimpanzees varies, the same way that human intelligence does. </div>
                    <div class="box2"> 
                        <h3>  Behavior </h3>
                        Chimpanzees are social animals. They live in communities that range from 20 all the way to 150 members. These communities tend to be divided into subgroups of just a few individuals that travel together. Male chimpanzees control and patrol the territory that they land upon, protect other group members and are in charge of searching for food.</div>

                        <h3> Tool Use </h3>
                        Chimpanzees have even been shown to use tools in order to help them accomplish tasks. Although their tool would still be considered primitive by human standards, it's fascinating to see creatures that are able to mimic actions that were once thought to be exclusive to humans. </div>
